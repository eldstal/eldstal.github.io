## Security advisory

An OS command injection vulnerability exists in the web interface of mobro-raspberrypi. It allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary OS commands on the host, with the privileges of the web server.

### Affected products

mobros-raspberrypi v12.3 and older

### Steps to reproduce

1. Visit `/api/log/index.php?lines=0 /dev/null;uptime;ls`

The output of the `uptime` command is shown in the HTTP response.

### Cause

An unsanitized GET parameter is passed to `shell_exec()` at [api/log/index.php:8](https://github.com/ModBros/mobro-raspberrypi/blob/fa0a9fa34cbeef664cf8d8fab8c2e7cea8a521c7/web/api/log/index.php#L8).

### Impact

An unauthenticated user is able to execute arbitrary OS commands by including semicolons in the `lines` parameter to terminate the intended command.

### Proposed Mitigation

Ensure that `$_GET['lines']` is numeric, as is already done in [the syslog component](https://github.com/ModBros/mobro-raspberrypi/blob/fa0a9fa34cbeef664cf8d8fab8c2e7cea8a521c7/web/api/syslog/index.php#L8).
